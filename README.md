# Meta Llama AI Academy Project

## Workshop Overview

**Meta Llama AI Academy** was a 3-day intensive workshop held from September 30th to October 2nd, 2024.

The core objective of this workshop was to implement better workflows using **Llama Local Model** and **Agent Architecture** with the theme of **"Future of Work"**.

Participants developed innovative solutions to solve real-world business problems through AI agents and local LLMs.

## Team Projects

### 01. Doc-To-RAG-Benchmark
**Multi-Agent Based Document Structure Optimization and Text Extraction Automation**

A project that addresses the limitations of manual RAG benchmark construction. It automates document structure-specific parsing performance limitations and manual QA data construction inefficiencies through a Multi-Agent system, automatically analyzing document structures to determine optimal parsing methods and building high-performance LLM-based benchmarks automatically.

### 02. LaLaLlama
**AI-Based Proposal Analysis and Evaluation System**

A proposal analysis and evaluation system developed using Multi-agent to solve difficulties in the bidding review process. By combining RAG, Multi-agent, and LLM technologies, it implements AI-based review automation, significantly improving the efficiency and accuracy of proposal evaluation.

### 03. RagLLama
**AI-Based Next-Generation HR Sourcing Agent**

An AI-based HR sourcing system that solves the problems of changing recruitment paradigms and increased search/selection burden on recruiters. It understands natural language queries and integrates multiple data sources (structured DB, unstructured documents, web search) through a LangGraph-based ReAct Agent structure to solve complex queries through reasoning-action iteration.

### 04. LlamaGuard
**AI-Based Code Security Review System**

A system that saves time by using AI to address the time-consuming process of manually classifying severity levels and creating patches for multiple issues in code security reviews. It utilizes Python, Llama-based on-device LLM with fine-tuning, Solar-pro2 LLM, LangGraph, and RAG technologies to automatically analyze and classify security vulnerabilities.

### 05. CTDMate
**CTD Document Auto-Generation System**

An AI-based system that solves the time and cost difficulties pharmaceutical companies face in CTD (Common Technical Document) creation. It provides a fully automated workflow where users upload documents, and the system performs automatic parsing, document generation, and outputs in the desired file format. It utilizes Solar-pro2 API, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct fine-tuned model, PyTorch, and LangGraph technologies.

### 06. SmartWay
**Analytics Agent for Structured Data Analysis**

A system that performs vehicle dispatch-related data analysis by designing an Analytics Agent for structured data analysis. It combines RAG and Analytics Agent technologies to automate complex data analysis tasks and provide insights.

### 07. YouCanDoIt
**Personal Work Information Centralization App**

An app that centralizes scattered work records and conversations into one hub for storage, search, and summarization, providing daily morning briefings. It automatically stores conversations/notes/information from all tools around a Context Registry (DB) and processes context retrieval, summarization, and briefing through an Agent Orchestrator that receives requests/schedules.

### 08. StartMate
**Startup-Focused IP/Patent Information Provision System**

An AI chatbot that solves difficulties in legal information verification, existing patent information understanding, and information security concerns. It provides patent and intellectual property information and technology trends to startup founders, utilizing Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Upstage Solar-pro2 API, LangGraph, intfloat/multilingual-e5-base, and other technologies.
